# Antibiotic-responsive promoter discovery

Identify *E. coli* genes and regulatory systems that suggest promoters worth
testing for biosensor design. Wet-lab antibiotics are **amoxicillin, cephalexin,
gentamicin, and tobramycin**: two beta-lactams and two aminoglycosides.

The primary analysis combines one GSE220559 RNA-seq benchmark, a joint PyDESeq2
count model, and same-release RegulonDB network and promoter annotations.
Ceftazidime/imipenem and kanamycin are class proxies; ciprofloxacin and polymyxin
E challenge cross-reactivity. This dataset does not directly test the four
wet-lab antibiotics.

Cached references and generated results are ignored by Git. The original
GSE220559 archive is retained. See the [data inventory](data/README.md) and
[results guide](results/README.md).

## Run the workflow

Use Python >=3.11. From the repository root:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m promoter_discovery.run_benchmark
python -m promoter_discovery.setup_data --download
python -m promoter_discovery.build_network
python -m promoter_discovery.score_candidates
python -m promoter_discovery.promoter_selection
python -m promoter_discovery.visualize_network
```

Reference acquisition requires network access. Once cached, omit `--download`
to verify the files. The default settings use `config/benchmark.json`,
`config/regulondb_assets.json`, and `config/regulondb.lock.json`.

The [workflow guide](docs/workflow.md) explains statistical assumptions,
reference verification, alternative flags, and optional PRECISE-1K annotations.
The optional custom per-dataset runner is
`python -m promoter_discovery.input_data --config <config>`; the primary
benchmark requires the joint model command above.

## View the results

Start with `beta_lactam_candidates.csv` and `aminoglycoside_candidates.csv` in
`results/promoter_candidates/`, then `results/promoter_review/promoter_review.csv`.
Open CSV files in a spreadsheet application. On macOS, view the network with:

```bash
open results/regulatory_network/regulatory_network.html
```

The class lists may overlap. Support labels describe measured comparisons,
not independent validation or calibrated biosensor performance. Annotated
promoter sequences need operator and fragment-boundary review before ordering;
wet-lab measurements establish transfer to the actual four antibiotics.

## Verification

```bash
python -m pytest -q
python -m promoter_discovery.setup_data
```

Tests use synthetic fixtures and do not download reference data. Cached
reference validation checks the release and file hashes. Do not edit lock
hashes to accept unexplained changes.
